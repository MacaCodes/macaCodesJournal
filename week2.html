        <h2>Week 2: HTML, CSS, SQL</h2>

        <h3>üîÆ Discoveries:</h3>
        <p>
          The second week added some colour and vibrancy, in that we can see
          more visually what we are creating with HTML and CSS. Covering the
          structure of a website, standardisation and conventions, hitting that
          SHIFT + ! to bring up the HTML boilerplate, and building a basic
          webpage with elements and containers. Settling the old debate of how
          to centre a div, I enjoyed playing around with flexbox. Flexbox games
          were fun and again super visual, intuitive and interactive. I‚Äôm
          excited to be building responsible and dynamic web pages, there‚Äôs
          still a long way to go but determined to get there! Discovering SQL
          commands, building tables, executing queries, filters, and realising
          CRUD operations on dummy data was quite fun, and I look forward to
          learning more about how front end and back end really do communicate.
        </p>

        <h3>‚õ∞Ô∏è Mountains climbed:</h3>
        <p>
          Well whilst I excelled at flexbox froggy and flexbox tower defence,
          actually putting that into my journal is a bit different. Again
          realising that obviously practice makes perfect, momentum and
          consistency will turn all them frogs into royalty. I‚Äôve struggled with
          taking CSS to the next level, especially around positioning of
          elements, media queries and the changing of images responsive to
          sizes, and creating a smooth UX/UI for users of my journal. It‚Äôs a fun
          journey, looking forward to seeing growth in ability.
        </p>

        <h3>üëæ Problems solved:</h3>
        <p>
          It took me hours to fix my navigation bar, to format my flexbox
          correctly, in the right place, in the right shape and form, but I did
          it. It also took me hours to correctly display my text, confusing
          myself with different element class names, div‚Äôs, articles, headings,
          sections, ID‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I started again and build the website from scratch,
          making sure I understood every part, and kept the names contextual and
          semantically solid. I‚Äôm still not 100% confident on CSS, especially
          pesky positioning, but I‚Äôve since followed a youtube project and it‚Äôs
          helped. Looking forward to build on this in the future with
          animations.
