            <h2>Week 1: JavaScript Fundamentals & Git</h2>

            <h3>üîÆ Discoveries:</h3>
            <p>I thoroughly enjoyed my first week of the bootcamp. It was an intense learning experience, daily coding
                and problem solving. I especially appreciate having support from the instructors, and the guided steps
                to setting up our environments, using terminal and basic git commands and repository management.
                Diving straight in, we explored JavaScript basics including syntax, variables, operators and even
                functions. I‚Äôve followed tutorials and had prior exposure to functions and objects, but the structure of
                my lessons is helping me better grasp the concepts, and I enjoy completing the tasks.

                for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
                // Code to be executed in each iteration
                }
            </p>

            <h3>‚õ∞Ô∏è Mountains climbed: </h3>
            <p>For the first week, some stand out errors must be my relationship with github. I feel like it should be
                more intuitive, and I‚Äôm still not used to the layout and tools. I appreciate how we started using the
                terminal straight away, and I‚Äôm excited to build up my knowledge on shortcuts and commands to manage
                code and commits. At the start, I was struggling with ensuring the correct folder was accessed and being
                uploaded, and the new terminology was confusing. By the end of the week, my confidence grew, the typical
                stop and start again technique works for a lot of scenarios, and I know with continued use I‚Äôll be a pro
                in no time. ü§û</p>

            <h3>üëæ Problems solved: </h3>
            <p>I‚Äôve realised that with coding, for me, repetition helps, and writing out the same code multiple times
                helps the concept stick, and I understand each argument, and how it relates to the overall objectives.
                For example, I was continuously playing around with creating countdowns, helping me solidify possible
                use cases of for loops in Javascript.
                for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { // Code inside the loop, executed 5 times console.log(i); } </p>
